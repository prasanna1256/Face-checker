Face Mask Detectionist
A web application that uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to detect whether individuals in images are wearing face masks.

Features
Upload images for face mask detection
Real-time analysis with visual feedback
High accuracy detection (95% in the full model)
User-friendly interface
Technology Stack
Frontend: React, Vite
Backend (simulated in this version): Python, TensorFlow, CNN Model
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Sklearn, PIL, OpenCV (CV2)
Project Background
This face mask detection system was developed to enhance public health safety during the COVID-19 pandemic. The model was trained on thousands of images to achieve 95% accuracy in detecting whether individuals are wearing face masks.

Key achievements:

Engineered an advanced face mask detection algorithm processing images in under 2 seconds
Boosted public health safety through accurate mask detection
Leveraged Deep Learning techniques to optimize model performance and reduce false positives by 20%
Installation
Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-mask-detection.git
cd face-mask-detection
Install dependencies

Current Limitations
This repository contains a simulated version of the face mask detection system. The full version would include a Python backend with TensorFlow to process the images using a trained CNN model.

Future Improvements
Implement the actual TensorFlow model for real detection
Add multi-face detection capabilities
Create a mobile application version
Improve the model's accuracy further
